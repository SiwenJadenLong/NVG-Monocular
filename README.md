# NVG-Monocular
A night vision monocular based on the PVS-69 Night Vision System

I wanted to practice more with PCB design, so I'm making this upgrade to my current usb-c powered night vision monocular.

### Minimal things needed:
- Somewhat small 1 Cell Charging and protection circuit
- 5V output for the Display and Camera
- 1000 mAh battery

### Things I'd Like, in order:
1. able to take and hotswap standard 18650 Cells
2. Fuel Gauge and auto shutoff at 3.2v
3. Oled Display displaying battery life
4. small buttons for camera settings

Current Hardware (11/24):
-RunCam Night Eagle v2
-What I think is a V760 Display Assembly
